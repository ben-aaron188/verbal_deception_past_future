Marianne Elzinga, an employee from the social sciences department, had sent me an email on the 18th of July. In this email she invited me to come to the university campus on the 5th of September, to kick off the start of the introduction week. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introductory program started at 9 AM. I live in The Hague, so I had to get up at 6.45 in order to appear at the meeting on time. At half past seven I took tram number 9 to the railway station in The Hague, and at five minutes to eight I was sitting, still very sleepy, in the train to Utrecht Central Station. Eventually I had to take the bus for an extra fifteen minutes to get to De Uithof (the university campus). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the email that Marianne had sent me, it read that my group, group number 9, would meet near a small café that is called The Basket. Accidently I knew exactly where The Basket was located, since I had already been to the university campus a week previously to take part in a math course that was obligated before I could start my new study. Besides, the building is very recognizable with a huge basketball field on top of the roof. Because of this I managed to get on time, arriving at five to nine that morning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I walked towards the building, I saw around a hundred prospective students standing in front of The Basket. The group consisted basically only out of girls: no more than fifteen guys were present. Amidst of all these people stood around twenty older students who would guide the different groups. They were easy to recognize, because many of them were holding self-fabricated signs on which they had written down the number of their corresponding group. The sight of this was a bit silly: many of the signs consisted of glitters and Disney-themed stickers, and some mentors were even wearing plastic crowns. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was walking towards The Basket, I looked around, searching for my introduction group. After a few seconds I spotted two female mentors, standing to the right of The Basket. They were holding a very cheerfully colored sign with the number 9 on it, and both were wearing a silver glittery boa around their necks. I raised my hand, strolled towards them, and introduced myself with a curtly “Hi, my name is Juul”. My mentors introduced themselves as Anne and Yasmin, and Anne subsequently crossed my name off from a list she was holding in her hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this brief encounter I walked a bit towards the other students (all girls) in my group. Everybody was looking into other directions and all looked a bit awkward, so I remember thinking that loudly introducing myself in public would probably not be a great idea. After a few seconds I realized I’d prefer standing a little bit further away than I was doing a that moment, so I walked in the opposite direction and started sending text messages to my friend Sofia from The Hague.';
